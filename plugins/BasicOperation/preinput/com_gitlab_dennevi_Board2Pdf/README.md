# Board2Pdf

Board2Pdf is a KiCad Action Plugin to create good looking pdf files from the board. The outputted pdf is vector based and searchable.

Two examples of what the plugin can output can be found here:<br>
[armory-Assembly.pdf](https://gitlab.com/dennevi/Board2Pdf/-/raw/main/resources/armory-Assembly.pdf "USB armory from WithSecure Foundry") (1 982 kB) Project is found [here](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory "USB armory from WithSecure Foundry")<br>
[hackrf-one-Assembly.pdf](https://gitlab.com/dennevi/Board2Pdf/-/raw/main/resources/hackrf-one-Assembly.pdf "HackRF by Great Scott Gadgets") (1 579 kB) Project is found [here](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf "HackRF by Great Scott Gadgets")<br>

When loaded the plugin looks like this. Here the user can configure how the pdf shall look.

This plugin ONLY works with the KiCad 6.0 and 7.0. It does NOT work with KiCad 5.1.x or earlier versions. Take the leap! You won\'t regret it.

## Installation
The easiest way to install is to open KiCad -> Plugin And Content Manager. Select Board2Pdf in the Plugins tab, press Install and then Apply Changes.

For instructions on manual installation, see [Wiki - Installation](https://gitlab.com/dennevi/Board2Pdf/-/wikis/Installation)

Also, see Dependencies below.

## Dependencies
For basic functionality Board2Pdf uses [pypdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf) which is included when installing Board2Pdf. You donâ€™t need to install any dependencies if this functionality is enough for you.

If you install [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) you can create the pdf files about ten times faster.

More information in [Wiki - Install dependencies](https://gitlab.com/dennevi/Board2Pdf/-/wikis/Install-dependencies).

## Usage
The plugin includes a default configuration which should make it more or less self explanatory if you test it out. The basic idea is that each template will result in a page in the pdf file that\'s created by this plugin. You can enable any number of templates to get different views and color modes of the pcb. Each template can be individually configured to give the desired output. It\'s completely up to you which layers to show, and which colors the layers shall have.
